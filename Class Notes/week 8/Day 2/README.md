>>In each of these examples, you:
* Define a constructor function to create new objects.
* Add methods to the prototype of the constructor function so that all instances of the objects share the same methods.
* Practicing with these examples will help you understand how to use prototypes to efficiently manage shared behavior in JavaScript objects.


1. Book Object
